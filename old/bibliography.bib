  abstract  = {Legged robots require accurate models of their environment in order to plan and execute paths. We present a probabilistic technique based on Gaussian processes that allows terrain models to be learned and updated efficiently using sparse approximation techniques. The major benefit of our terrain model is its ability to predict elevations at unseen locations more reliably than alternative approaches, while it also yields estimates of the uncertainty in the prediction. In particular, our nonstationary Gaussian process model adapts its covariance to the situation at hand, allowing more accurate inference of terrain height at points that have not been observed directly. We show how a conventional motion planner can use the learned terrain model to plan a path to a goal location, using a terrain-specific cost model to accept or reject candidate footholds. In experiments with a real quadruped robot equipped with a laser range finder, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach and discuss its benefits compared to simpler terrain models such as elevations grids.},

  abstract = {Contact mechanics plays an important role in the design, performance analysis, simulation, and control of legged robots. The Hunt–Crossley model and the Coulomb friction model are often used as black-box models with limited consideration of the properties of the terrain and the feet. This paper analyzes the foot–terrain interaction based on the knowledge of terramechanics and reveals the relationship between the parameters of the conventional models and the terramechanics models. The proposed models are derived in three categories: deformable foot on hard terrain, hard foot on deformable terrain, and deformable foot on deformable terrain. A novel model of tangential forces as the function of displacement is proposed on the basis of an in-depth understanding of the terrain properties. Methods for identifying the model parameters are also developed. Extensive foot–soil interaction experiments have been carried out, and the experimental results validate the high fidelity of the derived models.},

  abstract = {The accuracy of trajectory tracking and stable operation with heavy load are the main challenges of parallel mechanism for wheel-legged robots, especially in complex road conditions. To guarantee the tracking performance in an uncertain environment, the disturbances, including the internal-robot friction and external-robot and environment interaction forces, should be considered in the robot’s dynamical system. In this article, a neural fuzzy-based model predictive tracking scheme (NFMPC) for reliable tracking control is proposed to the developed four wheel-legged robot, and the fuzzy neural network approximation is applied to estimate the unknown physical interaction and external dynamics of the robot system. Meanwhile, the advanced parallel mechanism of the four wheel-legged robot (BIT-NAZA) is introduced. Finally, co-simulation and experiment results using the BIT-NAZA robot derived from the proposed hybrid control strategy indicate that the methodology can achieve satisfactory tracking performance in terms of accuracy and stability. This research can provide theoretical and engineering guidance for lateral stability of intelligent robots under unknown disturbances and uncertain nonlinearities, and facilitate the control performance of the wheel-legged robot in a practical system.},

  abstract  = {The wheel slip ratio is an important state variable in terramechanics research and the control of planetary rovers. Definitions of the slip ratio for a wheel with lugs and methods of estimating it for all wheels onboard have seldom been attempted. This paper presents several definitions for the slip ratio of a lugged wheel, which can be interconverted by altering the shearing radius. Equations for calculating the longitudinal velocity and slip ratio of a wheel moving on rough terrain are deduced from the horizontal speed of the wheel's axle. Wheel-soil interaction experiments were performed for two types of wheels with different radii and lugs of different heights. The drawbar pull, torque, and wheel sinkage were measured using sensors. These data confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed slip ratio definition methods. Furthermore, two slip ratio estimation methods are proposed and verified: a visual information-based method by analyzing the lug traces marked on the terrain with high precision, and a terramechanics-based method in which the equations for the vertical load and torque are solved to estimate the slip ratios of all wheels.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper presents analytical models to investigate the steering maneuvers of planetary exploration rovers on loose soil. The models are based on wheel-soil interaction mechanics, or terramechanics, with which the traction and disturbance forces of a wheel are evaluated for various slip conditions. These traction forces are decomposed into the longitudinal and lateral directions of the wheel. The latter component, termed the side force has a major influence in characterizing the steering maneuvers of the rover. In this paper, the wheel-soil mechanics models are developed with particular attention to the side force and the validity of the model is confirmed by using a single-wheel test bed. The motion profile of the entire rover is numerically evaluated by incorporating the wheel-soil models into an articulated multibody model that describes the motion dynamics of the vehicle's body and chassis. Steering maneuvers are investigated under different steering angles by using a four-wheel rover test bed on simulated lunar soil regolith simulant. The experimental results are compared with the simulation results using the corresponding model parameters. The proposed wheel-and-vehicle model demonstrates better accuracy in predicting steering maneuvers as compared to the conventional kinematics-based model. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract = {The future challenge for field robots is to increase the level of autonomy towards long distance (>1 km) and duration (>1h) applications. One of the key technologies is the ability to accurately estimate the properties of the traversed terrain to optimize onboard control strategies and energy efficient path-planning, ensuring safety and avoiding possible immobilization conditions that would lead to mission failure. Two main hypotheses are put forward in this research. The first hypothesis is that terrain can be effectively detected by relying exclusively on the measurement of quantities that pertain to the robot-ground interaction, i.e., on proprioceptive signals. Therefore, no visual or depth information is required. Then, artificial deep neural networks can provide an accurate and robust solution to the classification problem of different terrain types. Under these hypotheses, sensory signals are classified as time series directly by a Recurrent Neural Network or by a Convolutional Neural Network in the form of higher-level features or spectrograms resulting from additional processing. In both cases, results obtained from real experiments show comparable or better performance when contrasted with standard Support Vector Machine with the additional advantage of not requiring an a priori definition of the feature space.},

  abstract  = {Most of the time, the construction of legged robots is made in an empirical way and the optimization of the mechanical structure is seldom taken into account. In order to avoid spending time and money on the construction of many prototypes to test their performance, a CAD tool and a methodology seem to be necessary. In this way it will be possible to optimize on one hand the kinematic structure of the legs, on the other hand the gaits which will be used by the future robot. Thus, we have developed a methodology to design walking structures such as quadrupeds and bipeds, to simulate their dynamic behavior and analyse their performances. The feet/ground interaction is one of the major problem in the context of dynamic simulation for walking devices. Thus, we focus here about the phenomenon of contact. This paper describes a general model for dynamic simulation of contacts between a walking robot and ground. This model considers a force distribution and uses an analytical form for each force depending only on the known state of the robot system. The simulation includes all phenomena that may occur during the locomotion cycle: impact, transition from impact to contact, contact during support with static friction, transition from static to sliding friction, sliding friction and transition from sliding to static friction. Some examples are presented to show the use of this contact model for the simulation of the foot-ground interaction during a walking gait.},

  abstract = {Due to the technological advance, robotic systems become more and more interesting for industrial and home applications. Popular examples are given by robotic lawn mower, robot vacuum cleaner, and package drones. Beside the toy industry, legged robots are not as popular, although they have some clear advantages compared to wheeled systems. With their flexibility concerning the locomotion, they are able to adapt their walking pattern to different environments. For instance they can walk over obstacles and gaps or climb over rubble and stairs. Another possible advantage could be a redundancy for locomotion. A faulty motor in one limb could be compensated by other motors in the kinematic chain. As well, multiple failing legs can be compensated by an adapted walking pattern. Compared to this, the more complex mechatronic systems represent a major challenge to the construction and the control. This thesis is dedicated to the control of complex walking robots. Genetic algorithms are applied to generate walking patterns for different robots. The evolutionary development of walking patterns is done in a simulation software. Results of various approaches are transferred and tested on existing systems which have been developed at RIC/DFKI. Different robotic systems are used to evaluate the generality of the applied methods. Eventually, a method is developed that can be utilized, with a few system specific modifications, for a variety of legged robots. As basis for the development and investigation of several methods, software tools are designed to generalize the application of applying genetic algorithms to legged locomotion. These tools include a simulation environment, a behavior representation, a genetic algorithm and a learning and benchmark framework. The simulation environment is adapted to the behavior of real robotic systems via reference experiments. In addition, the simulation is extended by a foot contact model for loose surfaces. The evaluation of the genetic algorithm is done on several benchmark problems and compared to three existing algorithms. This thesis contributes to the state of the art in many areas. The developed methodology can easily be applied to several complex robotic systems due to its transferability. The genetic algorithm and the hierarchical behavior representation provide a new opportunity to control the generation of the offspring in an evolutionary process. In addition, the developed software tools are an important contribution for their respective research fields.},
