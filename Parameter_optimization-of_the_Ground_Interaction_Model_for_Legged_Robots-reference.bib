  abstract  = {In the recent past, mobile robots played an important role in the field of extraterrestrial surface exploration. Unfortunately, the currently available space exploration rovers do not provide the necessary mobility to reach scientifically interesting places in rough and steep terrain like boulder fields and craters. Multi-legged robots have proven to be a good solution to provide high mobility in unstructured environments. However, space missions place high demands on the system design, control, and performance which are hard to fulfill with such kinematically complex systems. My dissertation focuses on the development, control, and evaluation of a six-legged robot for the purpose of lunar crater exploration considering the requirements arising from the envisaged mission scenario. The performance of the developed system is evaluated and optimized based on empirical data acquired in significant and reproducible experiments performed in a laboratory environment in order to show the capability of the system to perform such a task and to provide a basis for the comparability with other mobile robotic solutions.},

  abstract  = {In this work, we describe a learning system that uses the CMA-ES method from evolutionary computation to optimize the morphology and the walking patterns for a complex legged robot simultaneously. Using simulation tools has the advantage that an optimization of robot morphology is possible before actually building the robot. Also, manually developing walking patterns for kinematically complex robots can be a challenging and time-consuming task. Both, the walking pattern and the morphology depend highly on each other to produce an energy-efficient and stable locomotion behaviour. In order to automate this design process, a learning system that generates, tests, and optimizes different walking patterns and morphologies is needed, as well as the ability to accurately simulate a robot and its environment. The evolutionary algorithm optimizes parameters that affect the trajectories of the robot's foot points, testing the resulting walking patterns in a physical simulation. The robot's limbs are controlled using inverse kinematics. In the future, the best solution evolved by this approach will be used for the mechanical construction of the real robot. Afterwards, the optimized walking patterns will be transferred to the real robot.},

  abstract = {Due to the technological advance, robotic systems become more and more interesting for industrial and home applications. Popular examples are given by robotic lawn mower, robot vacuum cleaner, and package drones. Beside the toy industry, legged robots are not as popular, although they have some clear advantages compared to wheeled systems. With their flexibility concerning the locomotion, they are able to adapt their walking pattern to different environments. For instance they can walk over obstacles and gaps or climb over rubble and stairs. Another possible advantage could be a redundancy for locomotion. A faulty motor in one limb could be compensated by other motors in the kinematic chain. As well, multiple failing legs can be compensated by an adapted walking pattern. Compared to this, the more complex mechatronic systems represent a major challenge to the construction and the control. This thesis is dedicated to the control of complex walking robots. Genetic algorithms are applied to generate walking patterns for different robots. The evolutionary development of walking patterns is done in a simulation software. Results of various approaches are transferred and tested on existing systems which have been developed at RIC/DFKI. Different robotic systems are used to evaluate the generality of the applied methods. Eventually, a method is developed that can be utilized, with a few system specific modifications, for a variety of legged robots. As basis for the development and investigation of several methods, software tools are designed to generalize the application of applying genetic algorithms to legged locomotion. These tools include a simulation environment, a behavior representation, a genetic algorithm and a learning and benchmark framework. The simulation environment is adapted to the behavior of real robotic systems via reference experiments. In addition, the simulation is extended by a foot contact model for loose surfaces. The evaluation of the genetic algorithm is done on several benchmark problems and compared to three existing algorithms. This thesis contributes to the state of the art in many areas. The developed methodology can easily be applied to several complex robotic systems due to its transferability. The genetic algorithm and the hierarchical behavior representation provide a new opportunity to control the generation of the offspring in an evolutionary process. In addition, the developed software tools are an important contribution for their respective research fields.},

Understanding the interaction dynamics between robots and such terrain is an important first step in enabling them to explore these environments. Terramechanics models are largely developed and tested on wheeled and tracked platforms, but with the advent of readily available lightweight legged robots, developing an understanding of how robot feet interact with the terrain becomes increasingly important. Works on estimating terramechanical properties of deformable sands and soils use an underlying assumption that translation of the robot foot along the surface of the terrain is due to internal shear deformation of the soil. We show that for lightweight legged robots, this is not the case. Shear forces acting on the foot of a robot during a stride are not accurately predicted by the widely-used Janosi-Hanamoto formula. We propose a new model in which two forces acting on the foot dominate the foot-terrain interaction - gross sliding friction and bulldozing resistance - and propose a model of how these forces act on the foot. We test this model on multiple soil types with different foot materials. Experimental data, collected on a testbench equipped with actuators and sensors identical to those deployed on a robot in the field, is used to validate our proposed model.},

A direct application of an on-road tire model to simulate tire behavior on a deformable terrain such as soft soil is not possible.

These methods are ranged from very simple empirical methods to highly complex finite element methods.

The emphasize is on the models that have made a significant contribution in advancement of techniques for characterizing soil, tire, soil–tire interaction, experimental analysis, model parameterization and model validation. A description is given for selected studies to familiarize the reader with the general terminologies, formulations and modeling approaches. More importantly, two summary tables are given for three groups of models in which the overall features of each model are reviewed and compared to other models.

The rocker and differential shaft fixed to the rocker are divided into three parts and reconnected via a novel angle-adjusting mechanism. The mechanism, which is driven by a single motor, widens and narrows the angle between the two rocker parts periodically to generate a wheel-step motion. Moreover, it adjusts the angle between a rocker part and differential shaft part to keep the bottom side of the rover body parallel to the ground. When fully stretched, the suspension lowers the bottom side horizontally to the lander platform. The mechanism also cooperates with a brake added between a rocker part and bogie to lift the sunken wheels separately. The strategies of wheel-step motion, wheel lifting, and suspension folding/unfolding are practicable as validated by prototype tests. Experiments show that the active suspension considerably enhances the rover's ability to escape from a dune or a crater. The proposed suspension is an important attempt in improving the design of Chinese Mars rovers.},

Then we describe a simple neural network called Walknet which exemplifies these properties and also shows some interesting emergent properties.

  abstract = {Sum-of-square based error formulations may be difficult to implement on an inverse analysis consisting of multiple tension-compression hysteresis loops. Five alternative measures of similarity between curves are investigated as useful tools to help identify parameters from hysteresis loops with inverse analyses. A new algorithm is presented to calculate the area between curves. Four additional methods are presented from literature, which include the Partial Curve Mapping value, discrete Fr{\'e}chet distance, Dynamic Time Warping, and Curve Length approach. These similarity measures are compared by solving a non-linear regression problem resembling a single load-unload cycle. The measures are then used to solve more complicated inverse analysis, where material parameters are identified for a kinematic hardening transversely anisotropic material model. The inverse analysis finds material parameters such that a non-linear FE model reproduces the behavior from five experimental hysteresis loops. Each method was shown to find useful parameters for these problems, and should be considered a viable alternative when sum-of-square based methods may be difficult to implement. It is important to consider multiple similarity measures in cases when it is impossible to obtain a perfect match.},

  abstract   = {Storing, querying, and analyzing trajectories is becoming increasingly important, as the availability and volumes of trajectory data increases. One important class of trajectory analysis is computing trajectory similarity. This paper introduces and compares four of the most common measures of trajectory similarity: longest common subsequence (LCSS), Fr\'{e}chet distance, dynamic time warping (DTW), and edit distance. These four measures have been implemented in a new open source R package, freely available on CRAN [19]. The paper highlights some of the differences between these four similarity measures, using real trajectory data, in addition to indicating some of the important emerging applications for measurement of trajectory similarity.},

  abstract = {As a measure for the resemblance of curves in arbitrary dimensions we consider the so-called Fréchet-distance, which is compatible with parametrizations of the curves. For polygonal chains P and Q consisting of p and q edges an algorithm of runtime O(pq log(pq)) measuring the Fréchet-distance between P and Q is developed. Then some important variants are considered, namely the Fréchet-distance for closed curves, the nonmonotone Fréchet-distance and a distance function derived from the Fréchet-distance measuring whether P resembles some part of the curve Q.},
